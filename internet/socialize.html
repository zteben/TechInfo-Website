<p>
The outcome of identity theft is usually the same, regardless of how the thief obtains your information. However, the Internet is providing new ways for people to steal your personal information and to commit fraud. Thieves can accomplish their goal several ways such as using Internet chat rooms and spreading Trojan horses that drop key loggers on your computer to transmit any passwords, usernames and credit card numbers you use on your computer back to the thieves. Many online businesses today also store personal information about customers and shoppers on websites, and this provides another way for your personal information to be accessed, without your permission or knowledge.

Additionally, email phishing is another way that thieves can attempt to gather your personal information. Phishing emails falsely claim to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam you into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. The email will direct you to visit a website where you're asked to update personal information, such as passwords and credit card, social security, and bank account numbers â€” information the legitimate organization already has. The website, however, is bogus and set up only to steal your information.
