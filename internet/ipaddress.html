<h2>IP address</h2>

<p>
An IP address, or simply an "IP," is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet or a local network. It allows a system to be recognized by other systems connected via the Internet protocol. There are two primary types of IP address formats used today â€” IPv4 and IPv6.
