A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including the following:
<ul>
<li>local-area networks (LANs): The computers are geographically close together (that is, in the same building).</li>
<li>wide-area networks (WANs): The computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves.</li>
<li>campus-area networks (CANs): The computers are within a limited geographic area, such as a campus or military base.</li>
<li>metropolitan-area networks MANs): A data network designed for a town or city.</li>
<li>home-area networks (HANs): A network contained within a user's home that connects a person's digital devices.</li>
</ul>
